! Lens Flare

$$Lens Flares$$ simulate the effect of lights refracting inside camera lens. They are used to represent really bright lights or, more subtly, just to add a bit more atmosphere to your scene.

The easiest way to setup a Lens Flare is just to assign the Flare property of the [[class-Light|Light]]. Unity contains a couple of pre-configured Flares in the [[HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets | Standard Assets package]].

Otherwise, create an empty $$GameObject$$ with ^^GameObject->Create Empty^^ from the menu bar and add the Lens Flare $$Component$$ to it with ^^Component->Rendering->Lens Flare^^.  Then and choose the ``Flare`` in the Inspector.

To see the effect of Lens Flare in the $$Scene View$$, check the ^^Fx^^ button in the Scene View toolbar:

!!Properties

||PROPS
||``Flare``       ||The [[class-Flare|Flare]] to render. The flare defines all aspects of the lens flare's appearance. ||
||``Color``       ||Some flares can be colorized to better fit in with your scene's mood. ||
||``Brightness``  ||How large and bright the Lens Flare is. ||
||``Directional`` ||If set, the flare will be oriented along positive Z axis of the game object. It will appear as if it was infinitely far away, and won't track object's position, only the direction of Z axis. ||


!!Details

You can directly set flares as a property of a [[class-Light|Light]] Component, or set them up separately as Lens Flare component. If you attach them to a light, they will automatically track the position and direction of the light. To get more precise control, use this Component.

A [[class-Camera|Camera]] has to have a [[class-FlareLayer|Flare Layer]] Component attached to make Flares visible (this is true by default, so you don't have to do any set-up).


!!Hints

* Be discrete about your usage of Lens Flares.
* If you use a very bright Lens Flare, make sure its direction fits with your scene's primary light source.
* To design your own Flares, you need to create some Flare Assets. Start by duplicating some of the ones we provided in the the ^^Lens Flares^^ folder of the Standard Assets, then modify from that.
* Lens Flares are blocked by $$Colliders$$.  A Collider in-between the Flare GameObject and the Camera will hide the Flare, even if the Collider does not have a $$Mesh Renderer$$.
