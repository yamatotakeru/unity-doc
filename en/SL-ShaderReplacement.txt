! Rendering with Replaced Shaders

Some rendering effects require rendering a scene with a different set of shaders. For example, good edge detection would need a texture with scene normals, so it could detect edges where surface orientations differ. Other effects might need a texture with scene depth, and so on. To achieve this, it is possible to render the scene with replaced shaders of all objects.

Shader replacement is done from scripting using [[ScriptRef:Camera.RenderWithShader.html|Camera.RenderWithShader]] or [[ScriptRef:Camera.SetReplacementShader.html|Camera.SetReplacementShader]] functions. Both functions take a ``shader`` and a ``replacementTag``.

It works like this: the camera renders the scene as it normally would. the objects still use their materials, but the actual shader that ends up being used is changed:
* If ``replacementTag`` is empty, then all objects in the scene are rendered with the given replacement shader.
* If ``replacementTag`` is not empty, then for each object that would be rendered:
** The real object's shader is queried for the [[SL-SubshaderTags|tag value]].
** If it does not have that tag, object is __not rendered__.
** A [[SL-SubShader|subshader]] is found in the replacement shader that has a given tag with the found value. If no such subshader is found, object is __not rendered__.
** Now that subshader is used to render the object.


So if all shaders would have, for example, a "RenderType" tag with values like "Opaque", "Transparent", "Background", "Overlay", you could write a replacement shader that only renders solid objects by using one subshader with RenderType=Solid [[SL-SubshaderTags|tag]]. The other tag types would not be found in the replacement shader, so the objects would be not rendered. Or you could write several subshaders for different "RenderType" tag values. Incidentally, all built-in Unity shaders have a "RenderType" tag set.

!! Shader replacement tags in built-in Unity shaders

All built-in Unity shaders have a "$$RenderType$$" tag set that can be used when rendering with replaced shaders. Tag values are the following:
* ``Opaque``: most of the shaders ([[shader-NormalFamily|Normal]], [[shader-SelfIllumFamily|Self Illuminated]], [[shader-ReflectiveFamily|Reflective]], terrain shaders).
* ``Transparent``: most semitransparent shaders ([[shader-TransparentFamily|Transparent]], Particle, Font, terrain additive pass shaders).
* ``TransparentCutout``: masked transparency shaders ([[shader-TransparentCutoutFamily|Transparent Cutout]], two pass vegetation shaders).
* ``Background``: Skybox shaders.
* ``Overlay``: GUITexture, Halo, Flare shaders.
* ``TreeOpaque``: terrain engine tree bark.
* ``TreeTransparentCutout``: terrain engine tree leaves.
* ``TreeBillboard``: terrain engine billboarded trees.
* ``Grass``: terrain engine grass.
* ``GrassBillboard``: terrain engine billboarded grass.


!! Built-in scene depth/normals texture

A Camera has a built-in capability to render depth or depth+normals texture, if you need that in some of your effects. See [[SL-CameraDepthTexture | Camera Depth Texture]] page. Note that in some cases (depending on the hardware), the depth and depth+normals textures can internally be rendered using shader replacement. So it is important to have the correct "$$RenderType$$" tag in your shaders.
