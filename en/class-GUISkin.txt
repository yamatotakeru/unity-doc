! GUI Skin

$$GUISkins$$ are a collection of $$GUIStyles$$ that can be applied to your GUI.  Each $$Control$$ type has its own Style definition.  Skins are intended to allow you to apply style to an entire UI, instead of a single Control by itself.

To create a GUISkin, select ^^Assets->Create->GUI Skin^^ from the menubar.

GUISkins are part of the $$UnityGUI$$ system.  For more detailed information about UnityGUI, please take a look at the [[GUI Scripting Guide]].


!! Properties

All of the properties within a GUI Skin are an individual [[class-GUIStyle | GUIStyle]].  Please read the [[class-GUIStyle | GUIStyle]] page for more information about how to use Styles.

!! Details

When you are creating an entire GUI for your game, you will likely need to do a lot of customization for every different Control type.  In many different game genres, like real-time strategy or role-playing, there is a need for practically every single Control type.

Because each individual Control uses a particular Style, it does not make sense to create a dozen-plus individual Styles and assign them all manually.  GUI Skins take care of this problem for you.  By creating a GUI Skin, you have a pre-defined collection of Styles for every individual Control.  You then apply the Skin with a single line of code, which eliminates the need to manually specify the Style of each individual Control.


!!! Creating GUISkins

GUISkins are asset files.  To create a GUI Skin, select ^^Assets->Create->GUI Skin^^ from the menubar.  This will put a new GUISkin in your $$Project View$$.

!!! Editing GUISkins

After you have created a GUISkin, you can edit all of the [[class-GUIStyle | Styles]] it contains in the Inspector.  For example, the ``Text Field`` [[class-GUIStyle | Style]] will be applied to all Text Field Controls.

No matter how many Text Fields you create in your script, they will all use this [[class-GUIStyle | Style]].  Of course, you have control over changing the styles of one Text Field over the other if you wish.  We'll discuss how that is done next.


!!! Applying GUISkins

To apply a GUISkin to your GUI, you must use a simple script to read and apply the Skin to your Controls.

[@
// Create a public variable where we can assign the GUISkin
var customSkin : GUISkin;

// Apply the Skin in our OnGUI() function
function OnGUI () {
	GUI.skin = customSkin;

	// Now create any Controls you like, and they will be displayed with the custom Skin
	GUILayout.Button ("I am a re-Skinned Button");

	// You can change or remove the skin for some Controls but not others
	GUI.skin = null;

	// Any Controls created here will use the default Skin and not the custom Skin
	GUILayout.Button ("This Button uses the default UnityGUI Skin");
}
@]

In some cases you want to have two of the same Control with different Styles.  For this, it does not make sense to create a new Skin and re-assign it.  Instead, you use one of the ``Custom`` Styles in the skin.  Provide a ``Name`` for the custom Style, and you can use that name as the last argument of the individual Control.

[@
// One of the custom Styles in this Skin has the name "MyCustomControl"
var customSkin : GUISkin;

function OnGUI () {
	GUI.skin = customSkin;

	// We provide the name of the Style we want to use as the last argument of the Control function
	GUILayout.Button ("I am a custom styled Button", "MyCustomControl");

	// We can also ignore the Custom Style, and use the Skin's default Button Style
	GUILayout.Button ("I am the Skin's Button Style");
}
@]
