!Installing Multiple Versions of Unity
You can install more than one version of Unity on your machine as long as you follow the correct naming conventions for your folders.  You need to rename each of the Unity folders themselves, so that the hierarchy looks like:

[@
Unity_3.4.0
---Editor
---MonoDevelop
Unity_4.0b7
---Editor
---MonoDevelop
@]

PC:

-> *Install Unity 4.0 (www.unity3d.com/download)
-> *When you install on PC it will select the previously installed directory - do not install here
-> *Create a new directory named sensibly e.g. Unity_4
-> *Name any shortcuts so you know which version you are launching
-> *Hold alt when you launch the beta to force unity to let you choose which project to open (otherwise it will try and upgrade the last opened project)
-> *Choose your  projectname_4 directory to open your backed up project

Mac:

-> *Find your existing Unity application folder and rename appropriately e.g Unity35 
-> *Install the Unity 4.0 (www.unity3d.com/download)
-> *Name any shortcuts so you know which version you are launching
-> *Hold alt when you launch the beta to force unity to let you choose which project to open (otherwise it will try and upgrade the last opened project)
-> *Choose your projectname_4 directory to open your backed up project

If you rename each Editor folder inside a single Unity folder you will overwrite the MonoDevelop folder and this will cause serious stability problems and unexpected crashes.
