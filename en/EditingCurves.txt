! Editing Curves

$$Curves$$ can be used for many different things and there are several different controls in Unity that use curves that can be edited.

* The [[AnimationEditorGuide| Animation View]] uses curves to animate properties over time in an $$Animation Clip$$.\\

''The Animation View.''

* Script components can have member variables of type [[EditingValueProperties40| AnimationCurve]] that can be used for all kinds of things. Clicking on those in the Inspector will open up the $$Curve Editor$$.\\

* The [[class-AudioSource| Audio Source]] component uses curves to control rolloff and other properties as a function of distance to the Audio Source.\\

While these controls have subtle differences, the $$curves$$ can be edited in the exact same way in all of them. This page explains how to navigate and edit curves in those controls. 

!! Adding and Moving Keys on a Curve

A $$key$$ can be added to a curve by double-clicking on the curve at the point where the $$key$$ should be placed. It is also possible to add a $$key$$ by right-clicking on a curve and select ^^Add Key^^ from the context menu.

Once placed, $$keys$$ can be dragged around with the mouse:

* Click on a $$key$$ to select it. Drag the selected $$key$$ with the mouse.
* To snap the $$key$$ to the grid while dragging it around, hold down ^^Command^^ on Mac / ^^Control^^ on Windows while dragging.

It is also possible to select multiple $$keys$$ at once:

* To select multiple $$keys$$ at once, hold down ^^Shift^^ while clicking the keys.
* To deselect a selected $$key$$, click on it again while holding down ^^Shift^^.
* To select all $$keys$$ within a rectangular area, click on an empty spot and drag to form the rectangle selection.
* The rectangle selection can also be added to existing selected keys by holding down ^^Shift^^.

$$Keys$$ can be deleted by selecting them and pressing ^^Delete^^, or by right-clicking on them and selecting ^^Delete Key^^ from the context menu.


!! Navigating the Curve View

When working with the $$Animation View$$ you can easily zoom in on details of the curves you want to work with or zoom out to get the full picture.

You can always press ^^F^^ to frame-select the shown curves or selected keys in their entirely.

!!! Zooming

You can ^^zoom^^ the Curve View using the scroll-wheel of your mouse, the zoom functionality of your trackpad, or by holding ^^Alt^^ while right-dragging with your mouse. 

You can zoom on only the horizontal or vertical axis:

* ^^zoom^^ while holding down ^^Command^^ on Mac / ^^Control^^ on Windows to zoom horizontally.
* ^^zoom^^ while holding down ^^Shift^^ to zoom vertically.

Furthermore, you can drag the end caps of the scrollbars to shrink or expand the area shown in the Curve View.

!!! Panning

You can ^^pan^^ the Curve View by middle-dragging with your mouse or by holding ^^Alt^^ while left-dragging with your mouse.


!! Editing Tangents

A $$key$$ has two $$tangents$$ - one on the left for the ingoing slope and one on the right for the outgoing slope. The tangents control the shape of the curve between the keys. The $$Animation View$$ have multiple tangent types that can be used to easily control the curve shape. The tangent types for a $$key$$ can be chosen by right-clicking the key.

In order for animated values to change smoothly when passing a key, the left and right tangent must be co-linear. The following tangent types ensure smoothness:
* ^^Auto^^: The tangents are automatically set so make the curve go smoothly through the key.\\

* ^^Free Smooth^^: The tangents can be freely set by dragging the tangent handles. They are locked to be co-linear to ensure smoothness.\\

* ^^Flat^^: The tangents are set to be horizontal. (This is a special case of ^^Free Smooth^^.)\\

Sometimes smoothness is not desired. The left and right tangent can be set individually when the tangents are ^^Broken^^. The left and right tangent can each be set to one of the following tangent types:
* ^^Free^^: The tangent can be freely set by dragging the tangent handle.\\

* ^^Linear^^: The tangent points towards the neighboring key. A linear curve segment can be made by setting the tangents at both ends to be ^^Linear^^.\\

* ^^Constant^^: The curve retains a constant value between two keys. The value of the left key determines the value of the curve segment.\\
