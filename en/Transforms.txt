!Transforms

$$Transforms$$ are a key $$Component$$ in every $$GameObject$$.  They dictate where the GameObject is positioned, how it is rotated, and its scale.  It is impossible to have a GameObject without a Transform.  You can adjust the Transform of any GameObject from the $$Scene View$$, the $$Inspector$$, or through Scripting.
