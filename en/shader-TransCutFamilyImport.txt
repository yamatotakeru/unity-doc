!! Transparent Cutout Properties

Cutout shader is an alternative way of displaying transparent objects. Differences between Cutout and regular [[shader-TransparentFamily|Transparent]] shaders are:
* This shader cannot have partially transparent areas.  Everything will be either fully opaque or fully transparent.
* Objects using this shader can cast and receive shadows!
* The graphical sorting problems normally associated with Transparent shaders do not occur when using this shader.

This shader uses an alpha channel contained in the ``Base`` Texture to determine the transparent areas.  If the alpha contains a blend between transparent and opaque areas, you can manually determine the cutoff point for the which areas will be shown.  You change this cutoff by adjusting the ``Alpha Cutoff`` slider.
