''All additional Terrain Settings''

!! Base Terrain

* ``Pixel Error`` controls the amount of allowable errors in the display of Terrain Geometry.  This is essentially a geometry LOD setting; the higher the value, the less dense terrain geometry will be.
*  ``Base Map Dist.``: The distance that Terrain Textures will be displayed in high-resolution. After this distance, a low-resolution composited texture will be displayed.
* ``Cast Shadows``: Should terrain cast shadows?

>>u40<<
``Material`` slot allows assigning a custom material for the terrain. The material should be using a [[Shaders|shader]] that is capable of rendering terrain, for example ``Nature/Terrain/Diffuse`` (this shader is used if no material is assigned) or ``Nature/Terrain/Bumped Specular``.

!! Tree & Detail Settings

* ``Draw``: if enabled, all trees, grass, and detail meshes will be drawn.
* ``Detail Distance`` distance from the camera that details will stop being displayed.
* ``Tree Distance``: distance from the camera that trees will stop being displayed.  The higher this is, the further-distance trees can be seen.
* ``Billboard Start``: distance from the camera that trees will start appearing as Billboards instead of Meshes.
* ``Fade Length``: total distance delta that trees will use to transition from Billboard orientation to Mesh orientation.
* ``Max Mesh Trees``: total number of allowed mesh trees to be capped in the Terrain.

!! Wind Settings

* ``Speed``: the speed that wind blows through grass.
* ``Size``: the areas of grass that are affected by wind all at once.
* ``Bending``: amount that grass will bend due to wind.
* ``Grass Tint``: overall tint amount for all Grass and Detail Meshes.
