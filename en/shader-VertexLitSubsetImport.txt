!! Vertex-Lit Properties

This shader is $$Vertex-Lit$$, which is one of the simplest shaders.  All lights shining on it are rendered in a single pass and calculated at vertices only.

Because it is vertex-lit, it won't display any pixel-based rendering effects, such as light cookies, normal mapping, or shadows.  This shader is also much more sensitive to tesselation of the models.  If you put a point light very close to a cube using this shader, the light will only be calculated at the corners.  Pixel-lit shaders are much more effective at creating a nice round highlight, independent of tesselation. If that's an effect you want, you may consider using a pixel-lit shader or increase tesselation of the objects instead.
