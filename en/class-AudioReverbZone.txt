! Reverb Zones.

$$Reverb Zones$$ take an [[class-AudioClip | Audio Clip]] and distort it depending where the audio listener is located inside the reverb zone. They are used when you want to gradually change from a point where there is no ambient effect to a place where there is one, for example when you are entering a cavern.
