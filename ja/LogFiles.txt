!Log Files

There might be times during the development when you need to obtain information from the logs of the webplayer you've built, your standalone player, the target device or the editor. Usually you need to see these files when you have experienced a problem and you have to know where exactly the problem occurred.

On Mac the webplayer, player and editor logs can be accessed uniformly through the standard ^^Console.app^^ utility.

On Windows the webplayer and editor logs are place in folders there are not shown in the Windows Explorer by default. Please see the [[AccessingHiddenFolders | Accessing hidden folders]] page to resolve that situation.

!! Editor
Editor log can be brought up through the ^^Open Editor Log^^ button in Unity's Console window.

||``Mac OS X``            ||~/Library/Logs/Unity/Editor.log||
||``Windows XP`` *        ||''C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Application Data''\Unity\Editor\Editor.log||
||``Windows Vista/7`` *   ||''C:\Users\username\AppData\Local''\Unity\Editor\Editor.log||

(*) On Windows the Editor log file is stored in the local application data folder: ''&#37;LOCALAPPDATA&#37;''\Unity\Editor\Editor.log, where ''LOCALAPPDATA'' is defined by [[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb762494&#40;VS.85&#41;.aspx | CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA]].

On Mac all the logs can be accessed uniformly through the standard ^^Console.app^^ utility.

!! Webplayer
||``Mac OS X``                        ||~/Library/Logs/Unity/WebPlayer.log||
||``Windows XP`` *                    ||''C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Temp''\UnityWebPlayer\log\log_UNIQUEID.txt||
||``Windows  Vista/7`` *              ||''C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp''\UnityWebPlayer\log\log_UNIQUEID.txt||
||``Windows Vista/7 + IE7 + UAC`` *   ||''C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\__Low__''\UnityWebPlayer\log\log_UNIQUEID.txt||

(*) On Windows the webplayer log is stored in a temporary folder:  ''&#37;TEMP&#37;''\UnityWebPlayer\log\log_UNIQUEID.txt, where ''TEMP'' is defined by [[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa364992&#40;VS.85&#41;.aspx | GetTempPath]].

!! Player
||``Mac OS X``      ||~/Library/Logs/Unity/Player.log||
||``Windows `` *    ||''EXECNAME_Data''\output_log.txt||

(*) ''EXECNAME_Data'' is a folder next to the executable with your game.

Note that on Windows standalones the location of the log file can be changed (or logging suppressed.)  See the [[CommandLineArguments | command line]] page for further details.

The device log can be accessed in XCode via GDB console or the Organizer Console. The latter is useful for getting crashlogs when your application was not running through the XCode debugger.

Please see [[http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/iphone_development/130-Debugging_Applications/debugging_applications.html | Debugging Applications]] in the iOS Development Guide. Also our [[TroubleShooting#iPhoneTroubleShooting | Troubleshooting]] and [[iphone-bugreporting | Bugreporting]] guides may be useful for you.

!Android!

The device log can be viewed by using the [[http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html#logcat | logcat console]]. Use the ``adb`` application found in ``Android SDK/platform-tools directory`` with a trailing ``logcat`` parameter:

@@$ adb logcat@@

Another way to inspect the LogCat is to use the [[http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/debugging/ddms.html | Dalvik Debug Monitor Server (DDMS)]]. DDMS can be started either from ``Eclipse`` or from inside the ``Android SDK/tools``. DDMS also provides a number of other debug related tools.
