!!Solo and Mute functionality

In complex state machines, it is useful to preview the operation of some parts of the machine separately. For this, you can use the Mute / Solo functionality. Muting means a transition will be disabled. Soloed transtions are enabled and with respect to other transitions originating from the same state. You can set up mute and solo states either from the ~~Transition Inspector~~, or the ~~State Inspector~~ (recommended), where you'll have an overview of all the transitions from that state.

Soloed transitions will be shown in green, while muted transitions in red, like this:

In the example above, if you are in @@State 0@@, only transitions to @@State A@@ and @@State B@@ will be available.

*The basic rule of thumb is that if one Solo is ticked, the rest of the transitions from that state will be muted. 
*If both Solo and Mute are ticked, then Mute takes precedence. 

Known issues:
* The controller graph currently doesn't always reflect the internal mute states of the engine.
