! Reporting crash bugs under Android
Before submitting a bug with just "it crashes" in the message body, please look through the [[TroubleShooting#AndroidTroubleShooting |Troubleshooting Android development]] page first.

At this point there are no advanced debug tools to investigate on-device app crashes. However you can use $$adb$$ application (found under Android-SDK/platform-tools) with $$logcat$$ parameter. It prints status reports from your device. These reports may include information related to the occurred crash.

If you are sure that the crash you're experiencing happens due to a bug in Unity software, please save the $$adb logcat$$ output, conduct a repro project and use the bugreporter (^^Help/Report a bug^^) to inform us about it. We will get back to you as soon as we can.
