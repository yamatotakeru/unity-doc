! Using the Inspector

The $$Inspector$$ is used to view and edit $$Properties$$ of many different types.

Games in Unity are made up of multiple $$GameObjects$$ that contain meshes, scripts, sounds, or other graphical elements like Lights. When you select a $$GameObject$$ in the Hierarchy or Scene View, the $$Inspector$$ will show and let you modify the $$Properties$$ of that GameObject and all the $$Components$$ and $$Materials$$ on it. The same will happen if you select a $$Prefab$$ in the Project View. This way you modify the functionality of GameObjects in your game. You can read more about the [[GameObjects#Relationship|GameObject-Component relationship]], as it is very important to understand.

When you create a $$script$$ yourself, which works as a custom Component type, the member variables of that script are also exposed as $$Properties$$ that can be edited directly in the Inspector when that script component has been added to a $$GameObject$$. This way script variables can be changed without modifying the script itself.

Furthermore, the Inspector is used for showing import options of assets such as textures, 3D models, and fonts when selected. Some scene and project-wide settings are also viewed in the $$Inspector$$, such as all the [[comp-ManagerGroup| Settings Managers]].

Any property that is displayed in the Inspector can be directly modified. There are two main types of Properties: $$Values$$ and $$References$$.
