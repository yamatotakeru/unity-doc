!!Velocity Over Lifetime Module
Attach:ShurikenVelocityOverLifetimeModule.png
Directly animates velocity of the particle. Mostly useful for particles which has complex physical, but simple visual behavior (like smoke with turbulence and temperature loss) and has little interaction with physical world.

Use constant color, random between two colors, animate it using gradient or specify a random color using two gradients (see  [[GradientEditor|Gradient]]). Note that this colour will be ''multiplied'' by the value in the $$Start Color$$ property - if the Start Color is black then Color Over Lifetime will not affect the particle.||
||``Color Scale``   ||Use the color scale for easy adjustment of color or gradient.||

!!External Forces Module
Attach:ShurikenExtForcesModule.png
||PROPS
||``Multiplier``||Scale factor that determines how much the particles are affected by wind zones (i.e., the wind force vector is multiplied by this value).


!!Collision Module
Attach:ShurikenCollisionModule40.png
Set up collisions for the particles of this Particle System. World and planar collisions are supported. Planar collision is very efficient for simple collision detection. Planes are set up by referencing an existing transform in the scene or by creating a new empty GameObject for this purpose. Another benefit of planar collision is that particle systems with collision planes can be set up as prefabs. World collision uses raycasts so must be used with care in order to ensure good performance. However, for cases where approximate collisions are acceptable world collision in ``Low`` or ``Medium`` quality can be very efficient.

!!!Properties common for any Collision Module
||PROPS
||``Planes/World``          ||Specify the collision type: ``Planes`` for planar collision or ``World`` for world collisions.||
||``Dampen``                ||(0-1) When the particle collides, it will keep this fraction of its speed. Unless it is set to 1.0, the particle will become slower after collision.||
||``Bounce``                ||(0-1) When the particle collides, it will keep this fraction of the component of the velocity, which is normal to the plane of collision.||
||``Lifetime Loss``         ||(0-1) The fraction of Start Lifetime lost on each collision. When lifetime reaches 0, the particle dies. For example if a particle should die on first collision, set this to 1.0.||
||``Min Kill Speed``        ||The minimum speed of a particle before it is killed.||

!!!Properties available only in the ``Planes`` Mode
||PROPS
||``Planes`` ||Planes are defined by assigning a reference to a transform. This transform can be any transform in the scene and can be animated. Multiple planes can be used. Note: the Y-axis is used as the normal of a plane.||
||``Visualization``    ||Only used for visualizing the planes: Grid or Solid.||
||>>>``Grid``           ||Rendered as gizmos and is useful for quick indication of position and orientation in the world.||
||>>>``Solid``          ||Renders a plane in the scene which is useful for exact positioning of a plane.||
||``Scale Plane``      ||Resizes the visualization planes.||
||``Particle Radius``  ||The assumed radius of the particle for collision purposes.||


!!!Properties available only in the ``World`` Mode
||PROPS
||``Collides With``    ||Filter for specifying colliders. Select ``Everything`` to colllide with the whole world.||
||``Collision Quality``||The quality of the world collision.||
||>>>``''High''``           ||All particles performs a scene raycast per frame. Note: This is CPU intensive, it should only be used with 1000 simultaneous particles (scene wide) or less.||
||>>>``''Medium''``         ||The particle system receives a share of the globally set ``Particle Raycast Budget`` (see [[class-QualitySettings|Particle Raycast Budget]]) in each frame. Particles are updated in a round-robin fashion where particles that do not receive a raycast in a given frame will lookup and use older collisions stored in a cache. Note: This collision type is approximate and some particles will leak, particularly at corners.||
||>>>``Low``            ||Same as ``Medium`` except the particle system is only awarded a share of the ``Particle Raycast Budget`` every fourth frame.||
||``Voxel Size``         ||Density of the voxels used for caching intersections used in the ``Medium`` and ``Low`` quality setting. The size of a voxel is given in scene units. Usually, 0.5 - 1.0 should be used (assuming metric units).||


!!Sub Emitter Module
Attach:ShurikenSubEmitter.png
This is a powerful module that enables spawning of other Particle Systems at the follwing particle events: birth, death or collision of a particle.
||PROPS
||``Birth``         ||Spawn another Particle System at birth of each particle in this Particle System||
||``Death``         ||Spawn another Particle System at death of each particle in this Particle System||
||``Collision``     ||Spawn another Particle System at collision of each particle in this Particle System. IMPORTANT: Collision needs to be set up using the Collision Module. See Collision Module||

!!Texture Sheet Animation Module 
Attach:ShurikenTextureSheetModule.png
Animates UV coordinates of the particle over its lifetime. Animation frames can be presented in a form of a grid or every row in the sheet can be separate animation. The frames are animated with curves or can be a random frame between two curves. The speed of the animation is defined by "Cycles".
IMPORTANT: The texture used for animation is the one used by the material found in the Renderer module.
||PROPS
||``Tiles``             ||Define the tiling of the texture.||
||``Animation``         ||Specify the animation type: Whole Sheet or Single Row.||
||>>>``Whole Sheet``    ||Uses the whole sheet for uv animation||
||>>>``- Frame over Time``   ||Controls the uv animation frame of each particle during its lifetime over the whole sheet. Use constant, animate it using a curve or specify a random frame using two curves. See [[ParticleSystemCurveEditor|MinMaxCurve]].||
||>>>``Single Row``     ||Uses a single row of the texture sheet for uv animation||
||>>>``- Random Row``     ||If checked the start row will be random and if unchecked the row index can be specified (first row is 0).||
||>>>``- Frame over Time``   ||Controls the uv animation frame of each particle during its lifetime within the specified row. Use constant, animate it using a curve or specify a random frame using two curves. See [[ParticleSystemCurveEditor|MinMaxCurve]].||
||>>>``- Cycles``        ||Specify speed of animation.||

[[#RendererModule]]
!!Renderer Module
Attach:ShurikenRendererModule40.png
The renderer module exposes the ``ParticleSystemRenderer`` component's properties. Note that even though a GameObject has a ``ParticleSystemRenderer`` component, its properties are only exposed here, when this module is removed/added. It is actually the ``ParticleSystemRenderer`` component that is added or removed.

||PROPS
||``Render Mode``             ||Select one of the following particle render modes||
||>>>``Billboard``            ||Makes the particles always face the camera||
||>>>``Stretched Billboard``            ||Particles are stretched using the following parameters||
||>>>``-  Camera Scale``      ||How much the camera speed is factored in when determining particle stretching||

||>>>``-  Length Scale``      ||Defines the length of the particle compared to its width||
||>>>``Horizontal Billboard`` ||Makes the particles align with the Y axis||
||>>>``Vertical Billboard``   ||Makes the particles align with the XZ plane while facing the camera||

||``Sort Mode``               ||The draw order of particles can be sorted by distance, youngest first, or oldest first.||
||``Sorting Fudge``           ||Use this to affect the draw order. Particle systems with ''lower'' sorting fudge numbers are more likely to be drawn last, and thus appear in front of other transparent objects, including other particles.||
||``Cast Shadows``            ||Should particles cast shadows? May or may not be possible depending on the material||
||``Receive Shadows``         ||Should particles receive shadows? May or may not be possible depending on the material||
