!What is a Tag?

A $$Tag$$ is a word which you link to one or more $$GameObjects$$. For instance, you might define "Player" and "Enemy" Tags for player-controlled characters and non-player characters respectively; a "Collectable" Tag could be defined for items the player can collect in the $$Scene$$; and so on. Clearly, Tags are intended to identify GameObjects for scripting purposes. We can use them to write script code to find a GameObject by looking for any object that contains our desired Tag. This is achieved using the ``GameObject.FindWithTag()`` function. 

For example:

[@// Instantiates respawnPrefab at the location 
// of the game object with tag "Respawn"

var respawnPrefab : GameObject;
var respawn = GameObject.FindWithTag ("Respawn");
Instantiate (respawnPrefab, respawn.position, respawn.rotation);@]

This saves us having to manually add our GameObjects to a script's exposed properties using drag and drop -- a useful timesaver if the same script code is being used in a number of GameObjects. Another example is a [[Trigger Collider -> class-SphereCollider]] control script which needs to work out whether the player is interacting with an enemy, as opposed to, say, a random prop or collectable item. Tags make this kind of test easy.


!!Applying a Tag

The $$Inspector$$ will show the Tag and [[Layer -> Layers]] drop-down menus just below any GameObject's name. To apply a Tag to a GameObject, simply open the Tags drop-down and choose the Tag you require:

Attach:TagDropdown.png

The GameObject will now be associated with this Tag.


!!Creating new Tags

To create a new Tag, click the "Add new tag..." option at the end of the drop-down menu. This will open up the $$Tag Manager$$ in the Inspector. The Tag Manager is described [[class-TagManager | here]].

Layers appear similar to Tags, but are used to define how Unity should render GameObjects in the Scene. See the [[Layers | Layers]] page for more information.


!!Hints

* A GameObject can only have one Tag assigned to it.

* Unity includes some built-in Tags which do not appear in the Tag Manager:
** "Untagged"
** "Respawn"
** "Finish"
** "EditorOnly"
** "MainCamera"
** "Player"
** and "GameController".

* You can use any word you like as a Tag. (You can even use short phrases, but you may need to widen the Inspector to see the tag's full name.)
