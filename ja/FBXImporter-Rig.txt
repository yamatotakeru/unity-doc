!FBX Importer, Rig options

The Rig TAB allows you to assign or create an avatar definition to your imported skinned model so that you can animate it - see [[Main.AssetPreparationandImport|Asset Preparation and Import]]

If you have a __humanoid character__ e.g. a biped (two legs) that has two arms and a head, then choose Humanoid and 'Create from this model' an Avatar will be created to best match the bone hierarchy - see [[AvatarCreationandSetup|Avatar Creation and Setup]] or you can pick an alternative avatar Definition that has already been set up.

If you have a non humanoid character e.g. a quadruped, or any animateable entity that you wish to use with [[MecanimAnimationSystem|Mecanim]] choose __Generic__ after choosing you will then need to identify a bone in the drop down to choose as the 
root node.

Choose legacy if you wish to use the legacy animation system and import and use animations as with 3.x
