! Accessing shader properties in Cg

Shader declares Material properties in a [[SL-Properties | Properties]] block. If you want to access some of those properties in a [[SL-ShaderPrograms | shader program]], you need to declare a Cg/HLSL variable with the same name and a matching type. An example is provided in [[ShaderTut2 | Shader Tutorial: Vertex and Fragment Programs]].

For example these shader properties:
[@
_MyColor ("Some Color", Color) = (1,1,1,1) 
_MyVector ("Some Vector", Vector) = (0,0,0,0) 
_MyFloat ("My float", Float) = 0.5 
_MyTexture ("Texture", 2D) = "white" {} 
_MyCubemap ("Cubemap", CUBE) = "" {} 
@]
would be declared for access in Cg/HLSL code as:
[@
fixed4 _MyColor; // low precision type is enough for colors
float4 _MyVector;
float _MyFloat; 
sampler2D _MyTexture;
samplerCUBE _MyCubemap;
@]

Cg can also accept $$uniform$$ keyword, but it is not necessary:
[@
uniform float4 _MyColor;
@]

Property types in ShaderLab map to Cg/HLSL variable types this way:
* Color and Vector properties map to $$float4$$, $$half4$$ or $$fixed4$$ variables.
* Range and Float properties map to $$float$$, $$half$$ or $$fixed$$ variables.
* Texture properties map to $$sampler2D$$ variables for regular (2D) textures; Cubemaps map to $$samplerCUBE$$; and 3D textures map to $$sampler3D$$.
