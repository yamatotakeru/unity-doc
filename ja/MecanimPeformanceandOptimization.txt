!Mecanim Performance and Optimization

This page contains some tips to help you obtain the best performance from [[MecanimAnimationSystem | Mecanim]], covering character setup, the animation system and runtime optimizations.

!!Character Setup

:Number of Bones:In some cases you will need to create characters with a large number of bones, for example when you want a lot of customizable attachments. These extra bones will increase the size of the build, and you could expect to have a relative processing cost for each additional bone. For example, 15 additional bones on a rig that already has 30 bones will take 50% longer to solve in ``Generic`` mode. Note that you can have additional bones in [[GenericAnimations | Generic]] and in [[AvatarCreationandSetup | Humanoid]] mode. When you have no animations playing using the additional bones, the processing cost should be negligible. This cost will be even lower if their attachments are non existent or hidden.

:Multiple Skinned Meshes:Combine skinned meshes whenever possible. Splitting a character into two [[class-SkinnedMeshRenderer | Skinned Mesh Renderers]] is a bad idea with regard to performance. It's better if your character has just one material, but there are some cases when you might require more materials.

!!Animation System

:Controllers:The [[class-Animator | Animator]] doesn't spend time processing when a [[class-AnimatorController | Controller]] is not set to it.

:Simple Animation:Playing a single [[class-AnimationClip | Animation Clip]] with no blending can make ``Mecanim`` slower than the [[Animations40 | legacy animation system]]. The old system is very direct, sampling the curve and directly writing into the transform. ``Mecanim`` has temporary buffers it uses for blending, and there is additional copying of the sampled curve and other data. The ``Mecanim`` layout is optimized for animation blending and more complex setups.

:Scale Curves:Make sure that there is not a single ``scale curve`` on any ``animation clip``. You can write an asset post-processor to remove or warn about them. See the [[BuildingAssetBundles | Asset Bundles]] section for more information. 

:Layers:Most of the time ``Mecanim`` is evaluating animations, and the overhead for [[AnimationLayers]] and [[AnimationStateMachines]] is kept to the minimum. The cost of adding another layer to the animator, synchronized or not, depends on what ``animations`` and ``blend trees`` are played by the layer. When the weight of the layer is zero, the layer update will be skipped.

:Humanoid vs. Generic Modes:These tips will help you decide between these modes:
 *When you have ``IK Pass`` enabled and ``Foot IK`` enabled on your ``animation states``, you will get better performance with ``Generic`` ``Mecanim`` mode.
 *When you use ``Generic``, using ``root motion`` is more expensive than not using it. If your animations don't use ``root motion``, make sure that you have no ``root bone`` selected.
 *On Android you will get worse performance since NEON is not currently supported on Android. ``Humanoid`` mode is particularly math heavy so it can easily be 2-2.5x slower without NEON.

:Mecanim Scene:There are many optimizations that can be made, some useful tips include:
 *Use hashes instead of strings to query the ``Animator``.
 *Implement a small ``AI Layer`` to control the ``Animator``. You can make it provide simple callbacks for ``OnStateChange``, ``OnTransitionBegin``, etc.
 *Use ``State Tags`` to easily match your ``AI StateMachine`` to the ``Mecanim StateMachine``.
 *Use additional curves to simulate ``Events``.
 *Use additional curves to markup your animations, for example in conjunction with [[TargetMatching | target matching]].

!!Runtime Optimizations

:Visibility and Updates:Always optimize animations by setting the animators's ``Culling Mode`` to ``Based on Renderers``, and disable the skinned mesh renderer's ``Update When Offscreen`` property. This way animations won't be updated when the character is not visible. See the [[class-SkinnedMeshRenderer | skinned mesh renderer]] for further information.
