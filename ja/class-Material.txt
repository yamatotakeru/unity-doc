! Material

Materials are used in conjunction with [[class-MeshRenderer|Mesh]] or [[class-ParticleRenderer|Particle Renderers]] attached to the $$GameObject$$.  They play an essential part in defining how your object is displayed.  Materials include a reference to the $$Shader$$ used to render the $$Mesh$$ or $$Particles$$, so these Components can not be displayed without some kind of Material.

!!Properties
The properties of any Material will change depending on the selected __Shader__.  These are the most often used properties:
||PROPS
||``Shader`` ||The Shader that will be used by the Material. For more information, read the [[Built-in Shader Guide]]. ||
||``Main Color`` ||Any kind of color tint can be applied.  Use white for no tint. ||
||``Base`` ||The $$Texture$$ that will be displayed. ||


!! Details

Materials are used to place [[class-Texture2D|Textures]] onto your GameObjects.  You cannot add a Texture directly without a Material, and doing so will implicitly create a new Material.  The proper workflow is to create a Material, select a Shader, and choose the Texture asset(s) to display along with it.  For more information on Materials, take a look at the Manual's page about [[Materials]].


!!! Choosing Shaders

After you create your material, the first thing you should decide is which Shader to use.  You choose it from the drop-down ``Shader`` menu.

You can choose any Shader that exists in your project's assets folder or one of the built-in Shaders. You can also create your own Shaders.  For more information on using the built-in Shaders, view the [[Built-in Shader Guide]].  For information on writing your own shaders, take a look at the [[Shaders]] section of the Manual and [[SL-Reference | ShaderLab Reference]].


!!!Setting shader properties

Depending on the type of shader selected, a number of different properties can appear in the $$Inspector$$.

The different types of Shader properties are:

||PROPS
||$$Color pickers$$ ||Used to choose colors. ||
||$$Sliders$$ ||Used to tweak a number value across the allowed range. ||
||$$Textures$$ ||Used to select textures. ||


!!!Texture placement

The placement of the textures can be altered by changing the ``Offset`` and ``Tiling`` properties.

||PROPS
||``Offset`` ||Slides the Texture around. ||
||``Tiling`` ||Tiles the Texture along the different axes. ||

!!Hints
* It is a good practice to share a single Material across as many GameObjects as possible.  This has great performance benefits.
