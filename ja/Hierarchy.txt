!Hierarchy

Attach:Editor-Hierarchy.png\\

The $$Hierarchy$$ contains every $$GameObject$$ in the current Scene. Some of these are direct instances of asset files like 3D models, and others are instances of [[Prefabs]], custom objects that will make up much of your game. You can select objects in the Hierarchy and drag one object onto another to make use of $$Parenting$$ (see below). As objects are added and removed in the scene, they will appear and disappear from the Hierarchy as well.

!!Parenting

Unity uses a concept called $$Parenting$$. To make any GameObject the child of another, drag the desired child onto the desired parent in the Hierarchy.  A child will inherit the movement and rotation of its parent. You can use a parent object's foldout arrow to show or hide its children as necessary.
