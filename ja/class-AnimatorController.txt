!!Animator Controller

You can view and set up character behavior from the ~~Animator Controller~~ view (Menu: ^^Window > Animator Controller^^).

An ``Animator Controller`` can be created from the ~~Project View~~ (Menu: ^^Create > Animator Controller^^).
This creates a @@.controller@@ asset on disk, which looks like this in the ~~Project Browser~~

After the state machine setup has been made, you can drop the controller onto the Animator component of any character with an Avatar in the ~~Hierarchy View~~.

->The Animator Controller Window

The ~~Animator Controller Window~~ will contain 
*The ~~Animation Layer Widget~~ (top-left corner, see [[Animation Layers]])
*The ~~Event Parameters Widget~~ (bottom-left, see [[Animation Parameters]])
*The visualization of the [[AnimationStateMachines|State Machine itself]].

Note that the ~~Animator Controller Window~~ will always display the state machine from the most recently selected @@.controller@@ asset, regardless of what scene is currently loaded.
